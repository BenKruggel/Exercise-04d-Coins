# Project-04-Platformer

## Implementation

Added menus, unique music for menus and levels, sound effect for coins and enemies, backgrounds for menus, various custom sprites, tweaked player movement to feel better to play. (increased speed, lowered min and max jump height), created elaborate levels with both tilemaps and various sprite assets, created points, health, and life mechanics. JUICED everything with cohesion and gameplay features (themed levels, music and sounds, easter eggs, health boosts, secret ending and various routing choices for player freedom). 

Menu background art, music and sound, slow and fast charging enemy sprites and tombstone sprite were all made by me.
